## Xerox
Hired via Comforce as UI Design specialist at Xerox in Webster, NY in the Experience Design Group. I worked to shape the user experience across the product's web and mobile interfaces as well as the product's onboard touchscreen UI. 

I was involved in every stage from wireframes and storyboards, building and user-testing prototypes at various levels of fidelity, and eventually overseeing the implementation and development of the features in the product itself. I was also responsible for all design and functional documentation of my products including style guides and layout guides, user experience standards, and keeping everything current and consistent across platforms in a rapidly-changing large-scale development environment with shifting priorities and timelines.

While there I was certified in Luma’s “Innovation Through Human-Centered Design” program to lead many valuable processes (such as persona development, user research, and ideation and brainstorming processes for stakeholders) to translate strategy, business requirements and usability best practices into best-in-class digital experiences.

#### Design and Functionality

If you've watched the UI video above, you can see why they need a designer that has experience with Mobile UX. We utilized the existing design language of mobile devices to create a touch-screen interface. This allowed us to use an existing vocabulary of interactions and design cues to create an intuitive system.

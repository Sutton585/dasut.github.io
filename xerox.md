## Xerox
Hired via Comforce as UI Design specialist at Xerox in Webster, NY in the Experience Design Group. I worked to shape the user experience across the product's web and mobile interfaces as well as the product's onboard touchscreen UI.

I was involved in every stage from wireframes and storyboards, building and user-testing prototypes at various levels of fidelity, and eventually overseeing the implementation and development of the features in the product itself. I was also responsible for all design and functional documentation of my products including style guides and layout guides, user experience standards, and keeping everything current and consistent across platforms in a rapidly-changing large-scale development environment with shifting priorities and timelines.

### Design and Functionality

If you've watched the UI exploration video above, you can see why they needed a designer that has experience with Mobile UX. We decided to utilize the existing design language of mobile devices to create a functional touch-screen interface. This allowed us to use an existing vocabulary of interactions and design cues to create a more intuitive system.

### Market Reception of Products
The product received a lot of positive attention in the industry because of it's clean modern look and usability.

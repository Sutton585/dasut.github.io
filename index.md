## Objective
I'm currently looking for an environment to make an impact by utilizing my unique background in both Human-Centered Design Thinking and Software Development. I’m looking for a long-term environment where I can continue to learn and grow. I'm very self-motivated, and love to work with growing organizations to establish a culture of human-centered product design.

I take a lot of pride in my ability to efficiently coordinate across departments and problem-solve with my team to find efficient solutions to complex business and user needs. I’m passionate about what can be accomplished with rapid iterative development, agile methodology, and human-centered design and the impact it can have for not only our products, but also for our users.
I’m currently freelancing and instructing part-time while organizing Upstate UX, a design organization I started for Rochester User Experience professionals.

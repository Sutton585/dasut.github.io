## Objective
I'm currently looking for an environment to make an impact in User Experience by utilizing my unique background in both Human-Centered Design Thinking and Software Development. I’m looking for a long-term environment where I can continue to learn and grow. I'm very self-motivated, and love to work with growing organizations to establish a culture of human-centered product design.

I take a lot of pride in my ability to efficiently coordinate across departments and problem-solve with my team to find efficient solutions to complex business and user needs. I’m passionate about what can be accomplished with rapid iterative development, agile methodology, and human-centered design and the impact it can have for not only our products, but also for our users.
I’m currently freelancing and instructing part-time while organizing Upstate UX, a design organization I started for Rochester User Experience professionals. 

#### Recent Projects:
- Spoke at RIT's National Technical Institute for the Deaf on the topic of Web Accessibility and Human-Centered Design.
- Instruction and facilitation for IDEO certification courses for a group of around one hundred students and design professionals in Rochester.
- Upstate UX symposium on inclusivness/diversity in our industry.
- Creating web-based solutions for Rochester companies through my freelance and contract work.

## Recent Employment History

### Web Design/Development and Educational Work
- 2010 - Current

#### Web Design/Dev & UX Consulting
Throughout my career, it’s been really valuable for me to freelance to keep building a steady stream of experience with varied technology in web design and development. By working with lots of very different clients, I encounter a lot of really interesting design challenges that I would never encounter in larger organizations.

Much of my UX work involves being a Subject Matter Expert (SME) on digital accessibility and conducting usability assessments against industry standards like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), and developing design documents like personas, storyboards, business plans, launch schedules, competitive assessments and product strategy work to lead cross-departmental collaboration efforts.

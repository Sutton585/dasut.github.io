## History

### Mirror Show Management, Interactive Design
- Interaction Design
- 2017 - *present*

In this role, I am responsible for designing and producing high-impact digital products, creating unique memorable experiences that companies use to represent themselves and their product internationally.

This role covers every aspect of the product development life-cycle; ideating, brainstorming, and pitching our ideas to clients, clarifying our direction and runway, documenting our design, determining scope, recruitment and management of development teams working in an agile environment, ensuring on-schedule delivery by hitting benchmarks, providing transparency for all stakeholders with regular release and testing, re-iteration and eventually deployment of our finished product, gathering metrics along the way that can help us on our next effort.

### Xerox

- 2015 - 2017

Hired through Comforce as UI Design specialist at Xerox in Webster, NY in the Experience Design Group. Responsible for design of our products in development, similar to a Product Owner thats primarily concerned with Usability and functionality. Organized my small team of designers and kept us on schedule.

In this role I also was able to do lots of product testing and and used a rapid prototyping and testing process to ensure high quality design for all our products.

### Apple
- UX User Interface Developer

Hired via Infosys Ltd. to be a UI/UX consultant at Apple Inc. in Cupertino, California. I was responsible for the design and development of several new product UI, with a focus on rapid prototyping and testing. Primary focus in front-end development and technical product management.

### Rochester Institude of Technology
- Interaction Design Assistant Teacher
- 2012 - 2014

Assisted in instruction, evaluation, and tutoring of students in the Human-centered computing program at Rochester Institute of Technology.

In this role I got my first taste of helping others learn how to get the most out of their work using human-centered design processes. Around the time this ended, I started building up Upstate UX, where I would be able to do the same, but on a larger scale.

### Freelance/Independent Web Design and Development
- 2010 - 2014

Designed and deployed custom websites on a freelance basis for companies and individuals around the Rochester NY area. Social media and blog management, content aggregation and publishing.

During my time as a student, I would regularly take on projects in web development and design. This experience is what set me apart from my peers as I had been gathering lots of development experience. This would evenetually result in Apple offering me a job before I had finished my Bachelor's Degree.

## Other Experience

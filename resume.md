Passionate about collaborative product development groups, user-centered design, devlopment, innovation, and leadership. Currently looking for a great environment to make an impact as a Product Manager (P.O. or similar) by utilizing my unique background in human-centered UX design and software development. Few have such a strong foundation of experience in design and development, and I want to find a environment to better utilize those areas of expertise instead of just picking one lane or the other, design or development.

My passion project is Upstate UX, a group I have created for designers, developers, and students to learn, teach, and collaborate in the Rochester area. We do workshops, discussions, networking, confereces, Q&A and community outreach. My goal is to see this amazing scale beyond the limits of what I can accomplish out-of-pocket.

## Employment History

### Mirror Show Management
- Interaction Design
- 2017 - *present*

I work to create unique memorable experiences that companies use to represent themselves and their product at trade shows around the world. Since this is a smaller company, I've had the opportunity to “wear many hats” and find interesting ways to use my human-centered design principles to create and articulate our design direction. In this role I design experiences with interesting bleeding-edge technology and even create one-of-a-kind technology solutions for the needs of the our clients.

This role takes a leadership position in many important parts of the product development life-cycle: brainstorm/ideation, presenting our design to stakeholders, clarifying our direction and scope, documentation, recruitment and management of development teams working in an agile environment, ensuring on-schedule delivery by hitting targets, providing transparency for all stakeholders with regular release and testing, re-iteration and eventually deployment of our finished product, and gathering metrics along the way that can help us on our next effort.

### Xerox
- UX/UI Interaction Design
- 2015 - 2017

Hired through Comforce as UI Design specialist at Xerox in Webster, NY in the Experience Design Group. Responsible for design of our products in development, similar to a Product Owner thats primarily concerned with Usability and functionality. Organized my small team of product/UI designers and kept us on schedule.

In this role I also was able to do lots of product testing and and used a rapid prototyping and testing process to ensure high quality design for all our products.

### Apple
- UX User Interface Developer
- 2013 - 2014

Hired via Infosys Ltd. to be a UI/UX consultant at Apple Inc. in Cupertino, California. I was responsible for the design and development of several new product UI, with a focus on rapid prototyping. Primary focus in front-end development and technical product management.

### Freelance/Independent Web Design and Development
- 2010 - 2018

Designed and deployed custom websites on a freelance basis for companies and individuals around the Rochester NY area. Social media and blog management, content aggregation and publishing.

During my time as a student, I would regularly take on projects in web development and design. This experience is what set me apart from my peers as I had been gathering lots of development experience. This would evenetually result in Apple offering me a job before I had finished my Bachelor's Degree. More recently, as a consultant, I have been able to freelance between contracts.

## Other Experience

### Upstate User Experience Group
Created UpstateUX.com for user experience professionals in Upstate New York to meet up for events, conferences, social gatherings, networking and general professional development. Ever expanding, with multiple events planned and partners and sponsors.

### Udemy Product Managment Fundamentals
In many of my roles, I have often served as almost a pseudo Product Owner with a strong emphasis on design and usablility. Now that I'm intentionally looking to find an appropriate Product Managment role to make the most of my broad skillset, I started these Udemy courses in order to gain certifications related to Product Managment.

### Luma Institute’s “Innovation through Human-Centered Design“
Trained in the Luma Institute’s program on practices for innovation in human-centered design. Progressed all the way through the advanced HCD courses, qualifying as an instructor and facilitator of the Luma’s courses and putting their techniques into practice in cross-departmental teams.

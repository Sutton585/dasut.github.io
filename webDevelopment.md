## Current Work:

I’m currently working to migrate a very large and very active group from an old email-based communication platform (ListServ) onto a whole new platform. This has been a very interesting ongoing project, and I’m learning a lot about different tech solutions for to fit the user and business needs.

## Notes on Recent Work 

### [microbiologynetwork.com](http://microbiologynetwork.com)
  - Designed then handed off for development with the company's proprietary CMS. (I do not recommend, many issues with the responsive design)
  - This is an older site, and a ground-up redesign is planned on all new platform. I'm pilotting the new stack with cqc.network, then migrating this content over if the results are good.
  
### [cqc.network](https://cqc.network) 
  - Made for a local company in Rochester, very simple but expanding into an ecommerce and event management website currently.
  - Development: HTML5/CSS/javescript/jQuery
  
### [DavidSutton.net](https://DavidSutton.net)
  - Out-of-date portfolio site
  - CMS used: Wordpress
  - Development: HTML5/CSS/javescript/jQuery/PHP/MySQL

### [dasut.net](https://dasut.net)
  - Second Iteration of the portfolio, totally different tech used.
  - Frameworks used: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
  - Hugo is a goLang-based framework turning markdown to static HTML/CSS content, lots of work managing a server with goLang environment and cron jobs to parse markdown content via git, then through Hugo, which is why I use Jekyll now. But it was really interesting to set up and run, and most of the work was just in teaching it how to interpret things in CSS.

### [dasut.github.io](dasut.github.io)
  - Current Portfolio Site 
  - Frameworks used: Jekyll
  - [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a Ruby-based framework that pareses markdown into static HTML/CSS content, this is much easier to maintain because it’s supported by gitHub pages, so instead of running a server to pull my latest version from git and compile on a schedule set by cron job, I can just have gitHub itself take care of everything automagically.

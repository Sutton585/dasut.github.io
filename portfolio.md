## Interactive Game Show Experience

My experience in Game Design, UX  and Product Design helped us design a truly unique gaming experience for Mirror Show Managment. The physical design consisted of three touch screen kiosks that registered players and their game pieces via RFID technology, allowing up to 3 parties to compete in a Monopoly-inspired board game with an industry-specific twist. The game board and scores were displayed on six foot by six foot LED/LCD displays in the center of the booth, allowing players and spectators to see the impact of everyone’s game play choices in real time.

## Trello Job App

As an exercise, I designed a UI and mapped out a few behaviors for a fictional piece of software. The goal was to use a pre-existing brand, and show how their design team might approach an online resume-importing tool within their established style. It needs to be something that can preserve the design of the resume, yet still import all the relevant information into text for the employer’s system.

The existing brand style I used for the exercise is trello.com. If you’re familiar with Trello, you can definitely notice this has their style all over it.

## RIT Underground Mapping Project

While at Rochester Institute of Technology, I took on a big project of creating a more intuitive system for navigating the campus. The core of the idea was the underground tunnels that most students didn't know anything about. There's a full User-Centric approach being used here (and lots of documentation) showing how we might better meet the needs of the students and faculty.

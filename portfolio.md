### Summary

I was brought on as the UI Design specialist at Xerox in Webster, NY in the Experience Design Group for the new generation of mobile-like interfaces. I work mostly in the design and development of UI for touchscreen devices. Integrating iterative user-centered design principles into product design and information architecture design.

If you've watched the UI video above, you can imagine why they needed a designer that has experience with mobile UX. We utilized the existing design language of mobile devices to create a touch-screen interface that has been recieving a lot of positive attention in the industry because of it's clean modern look and usibality.

>**Disclaimer:** Please understand that this is not an exhaustive list of all my work, it’s a taste of what I do to give you a feel for who I am. In order to comply with non-disclosure agreements, __I do not make available much of the visuals I have done (epecially Xerox and Apple) unless express permission is given.__

*This portfolio is being totally re-done and redesigned with case studies, design samples, and more written content about the work. Plpease pardon the dust as it's all being temporarily dumped onto this page while I build out the new portfolio.*

## Xerox UI/UX and Product Design Work

I was brought on as the UI Design specialist at Xerox in Webster, NY in the Experience Design Group for the new generation of mobile-like interfaces. I work mostly in the design and development of UI for touchscreen devices. Integrating iterative user-centered design principles into product design and information architecture design.

## Interaction Design Projects

During my time at Rochester Institute of Technology, my concentrations were related to Interaction Design an Web Design/Development. Since there wasn't a formal school for Interaction Design, a lot of the work was driven independent study and by one-on-one work with professors.

## Trello Job App

>[Here's a link to the design on my older website](http://www.davidsutton.net/portfolio/trello-resume-importer/), the page you're viewing right now is a work-in-progress.

As an exercise for myself, I designed a UI and mapped out a few behaviors for a fictional piece of software. The goal was to use a pre-existing brand, and show how their design team might approach an online resume-importing tool within their established style. It needs to be something that can preserve the design of the resume, yet still import all the relevant information into text for the employer’s system.

The existing brand style I used for the exercise is trello.com. If you’re familiar with Trello, you can definitely notice this has their style all over it.

## RIT Underground Mapping Project

#### [Documentation from Researching on-campus needs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Bosf_Ilz7tFD7B4myXvuxNiSJYXsjUlr8NCyIDbcoY/edit)

>Pardon the Google doc, I'll work on migrating this document to the new format, until then I'll keep the Google doc public.

In this document, I researched various reported issues by RIT students, including library resources being bottlenecked unnecessarily, and a lackluster mapping system for the campus.
My group ended up deciding to move forward in laying out solutions to the map systems, but at the time this was written, we hadn't decided which issue would be the more productive option to pursue.

#### [Outline for user-polling](pollingMethods)

In this document, I explain out methodology for polling students for information that might help us create a solution to the current weaknesses in RIT's mapping system.

#### [Usability survey for RIT map app](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1plCUeQVDPoAPtTW9m6r_X8RClBjKlRSPq1SRBxuFCP0/edit)

>This link brings you to the actual google form that was used to poll students.

This is the online poll given out to RIT students to gauge need and interest in a new application to help navigation across the large campus. We planned to use this feedback from students to create a solution for students.

#### [Features and content of new Mapping Application](/MapAppDocs)
Once we had fully committed to addressing the mapping issue, we discussed further features that could be added to the application. Feature creep was becoming a major concern, but much of this document is a direct result of my one-on-one discussion with our very excited professor that had all sorts of new technology he thought would fit perfectly in our project. As a result, our simple mapping application now has augmented reality and social features, as well as customized suggestions based on their class schedule and lots of GPS features similar to Waze.

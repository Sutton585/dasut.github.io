### Summary

I was brought on as the UI Design specialist at Xerox in Webster, NY in the Experience Design Group for the new generation of mobile-like interfaces. I work mostly in the design and development of UI for touchscreen devices. Integrating iterative user-centered design principles into product design and information architecture design.

If you've watched the UI video above, you can imagine why they needed a designer that has experience with mobile UX.

#### Market Reception of Products

[Xerox Summary of Reviews](http://connect.blogs.xerox.com/2017/02/28/the-reviews-are-in-and-theyre-winners/)

[Complete review from BuyersLab](https://www.buyerslab.com/News/Industry-News/2016/November/New-Xerox-Color-Printer-and-MFP-for-Small-Offices), the standard for high-quality testing of document and digital imaging products.

### [Detailed Description of Independent Study](/IndStudyNotes.html)

This is a description of areas of study involved in a course designed for my IT concentration Interactive Design at Rochester Institute of Technology.

### [Iterative Design Documentation](IDgeneral)

In a section of my Interactive Design HCI concentration, I wrote about how to streamline a process for user-centric iterative design that focused on quickly moving from user testing to design revisions. This is the first half of that report.
My original hypothesis was that I would create a tiny easy to run project, and let future revisions be completely dictated by what could be learned from user-testing. This requires very fast prototyping and streamlined testing.
The specifics of the exact project used as a proof-of-concept are in another document.

## RIT Underground Mapping Project

#### [Documentation from Researching on-campus needs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Bosf_Ilz7tFD7B4myXvuxNiSJYXsjUlr8NCyIDbcoY/edit)

>Pardon the Google doc, I'll work on migrating this document to the new format, until then I'll keep the Google doc public.

In this document, I researched various reported issues by RIT students, including library resources being bottlenecked unnecessarily, and a lackluster mapping system for the campus.
My group ended up deciding to move forward in laying out solutions to the map systems, but at the time this was written, we hadn't decided which issue would be the more productive option to pursue.

#### [Outline for user-polling](pollingMethods)

In this document, I explain out methodology for polling students for information that might help us create a solution to the current weaknesses in RIT's mapping system.

#### [Usability survey for RIT map app](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1plCUeQVDPoAPtTW9m6r_X8RClBjKlRSPq1SRBxuFCP0/edit)

>This link brings you to the actual google form that was used to poll students.

This is the online poll given out to RIT students to gauge need and interest in a new application to help navigation across the large campus. We planned to use this feedback from students to create a solution for students.

#### [Features and content of new Mapping Application](/MapAppDocs)
Once we had fully committed to addressing the mapping issue, we discussed further features that could be added to the application. Feature creep was becoming a major concern, but much of this document is a direct result of my one-on-one discussion with our very excited professor that had all sorts of new technology he thought would fit perfectly in our project. As a result, our simple mapping application now has augmented reality and social features, as well as customized suggestions based on their class schedule and lots of GPS features similar to Waze.

## Trello Job App

>[Here's a link to the design on my older website](http://www.davidsutton.net/portfolio/trello-resume-importer/), the page you're viewing right now is a work-in-progress.

As an exercise for myself, I designed a UI and mapped out a few behaviors for a fictional piece of software. The goal was to use a pre-existing brand, and show how their design team might approach an online resume-importing tool within their established style. It needs to be something that can preserve the design of the resume, yet still import all the relevant information into text for the employer’s system.

The existing brand style I used for the exercise is trello.com. If you’re familiar with Trello, you can definitely notice this has their style all over it.

## Game-Related Design

### Card Game Design

>[Here's a link to the cards on my older website](http://www.davidsutton.net/portfolio/dodgeball-title/), the page you're viewing right now is a work-in-progress.

- [Notes from a few user-testing sessions](playtestNotes)
- [Rules: Version 2](rules)
- [Card Design (currently links to older site)](http://www.davidsutton.net/portfolio/dodgeball-title/)

This is a card game I made a few years ago. It started out very simple, but I ended up using it for a study I wrote as a user testing to guide iterative game design. The idea was to start with a simple game, user-test, iterate, and end up with something amazing.

Right now, the images [in this link](](http://www.davidsutton.net/portfolio/dodgeball-title/)) are roughs of the cards from the latest iteration that went to print. As a result, I left in the cut and bleed lines so that you can see more than what made it onto the card. I might clean the images up a bit as I revise this portfolio section. Leaving bleed lines in gives a good impression of how they're printed, but I think it might look sloppy for an online portfolio.

### [Horror Western RPG Game Design](http://www.davidsutton.net/portfolio/horror-western/)

>To view the headshots for some of the circular character pieces, [please follow this link to the older version of my website](http://www.davidsutton.net/portfolio/horror-western/), the page you're viewing right now is a work-in-progress.

This is another game design project. I worked on the setting for a tabletop RPG that mashes up the “wild west” feel with a supernatural horror. This was a lot of fun for me.

The most natural setting for the game was Deadwood, South Dakota. So many legendary figures of the old west came through that town, and I have the benefit of a great HBO show to guide some of the art. The style I was going for is a mash-up of the Deadwood TV show and the art style from the video game Borderlands. What I wanted to end up with is sort of a grungy but high contrast comic feel.

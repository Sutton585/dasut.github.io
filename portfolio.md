### Summary

I was brought on as the UI Design specialist at Xerox in Webster, NY in the Experience Design Group for the new generation of mobile-like interfaces. I work mostly in the design and development of UI for touchscreen devices. Integrating iterative user-centered design principles into product design and information architecture design.

If you've watched the UI video above, you can imagine why they needed a designer with technical know-how and experience with mobile UX.

## Trello Job App

>[Here's a link to the design on my older website](http://www.davidsutton.net/portfolio/trello-resume-importer/), the page you're viewing right now is a work-in-progress.

As an exercise for myself, I designed a UI and mapped out a few behaviors for a fictional piece of software. The goal was to use a pre-existing brand, and show how their design team might approach an online resume-importing tool within their established style. It needs to be something that can preserve the design of the resume, yet still import all the relevant information into text for the employer’s system.

The existing brand style I used for the exercise is trello.com. If you’re familiar with Trello, you can definitely notice this has their style all over it.

## Card Game Design

>[Here's a link to the cards on my older website](http://www.davidsutton.net/portfolio/dodgeball-title/), the page you're viewing right now is a work-in-progress.

This is a card game I made a few years ago. It started out very simple, but I ended up using it for a study I wrote as a user testing to guide iterative game design. The idea was to start with a simple game, user-test, iterate, and end up with something amazing.

Right now, the images below are roughs of the cards from the latest iteration that went to print. As a result, I left in the cut and bleed lines so that you can see more than what made it onto the card. I might clean the images up a bit as I revise this portfolio section. Leaving bleed lines in gives a good impression of how they're printed, but I think it might look sloppy for an online portfolio.


## Horror Western RPG Game Design

>To view the headshots for some of the circular character pieces, [please follow this link to the older version of my website](http://www.davidsutton.net/portfolio/horror-western/), the page you're viewing right now is a work-in-progress.

This is another game design project. I worked on the setting for a tabletop RPG that mashes up the “wild west” feel with a supernatural horror. This was a lot of fun for me.

The most natural setting for the game was Deadwood, South Dakota. So many legendary figures of the old west came through that town, and I have the benefit of a great HBO show to guide some of the art. The style I was going for is a mash-up of the Deadwood TV show and the art style from the video game Borderlands. What I wanted to end up with is sort of a grungy but high contrast comic feel.

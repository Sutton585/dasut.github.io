#RIT-Related Projects
These are relevant documents that were used for projects at RIT.

##General Projects

###[Iterative Design Documentation](https://www.dropbox.com/s/96ylmyekitlvhet/IDgeneral.md?dl=0)
>In another section of my Interactive Design HCI concentration, I wrote this report on how to streamline a process for user-centric iterative design that focused on quickly moving from user testing to design revisions. This is the first half of that report.
My original hypothesis was that I would create a tiny easy to run project, and let future revisions be completely dictated by what could be learned from user-testing. This requires very fast prototyping and streamlined testing.
The specifics of the exact project used as a proof-of-concept are in another document.

###[Detailed Description of Independent Study](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cfws3tfgvp9thv3/IndStudy3Notes.mdown?dl=0)
>This is a description of areas of study involved in a course designed for my IT concentration Interactive Design.

###[LectureBuddy Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kl8QE6qUZn13kt_GH4Zc1125Ww6u_AuAS1HaAbtc8w8/edit#)
>This document describes our approach to a project where we invented a new "innovation". Our product was an implementation of voice recording, note-taking, and automated wiki-populating for the purposes of lecture notes for students. RIT has a large deaf community, and students in general love having detailed notes.

###[Re-impementation of a course website](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-qaAjDbdI2gi8EJURYYTByYaOaREac1QHN3DqXPcXcA/edit)
>This project involved taking a standard (but really poorly implemented) homepage for a given course, and rehauling it from the ground up to be easier and more informative for both professors and students. In this document, we see design notes from general design perspective as well as information gathered from an interview and needs assessment from a professor.
I still have the redesigned site in my dropbox, if this document is interesting to you.

###[Iconia Keyboard Heuristic Evaluation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xn5vXPLoIpzR64R5NP3J3ktW5g7fp3eHps_JY-Zk10E/edit?usp=sharing)
>This is a preliminary draft to demonstrate a heuristic evaluation of a touchscreen keyboard. It was used in a series of documents to illustrate how interaction design documents can work within larger projects.

##HCI-Specific Projects
###[Documentation from Researching on-campus needs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Bosf_Ilz7tFD7B4myXvuxNiSJYXsjUlr8NCyIDbcoY/edit)
>In this document, our team researched various reported issues by RIT students, including library resources being bottlenecked unnecessarily, and a lackluster mapping system for the campus.
We ended up deciding to move forward in laying out solutions to the map systems, but at the time this was written, we hadn't decided which issue would be the more productive option to pursue.

###[Outline for user-polling](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12PHJ76GOl1eDw-4nvpgi0vFXapX8ZAdHFAyqFe4hCkA/edit)
>In this document, we explain out methodology for polling students for information that might help us create a solution to the current weaknesses in RIT's mapping system.

###[Usability survey for RIT map app](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1plCUeQVDPoAPtTW9m6r_X8RClBjKlRSPq1SRBxuFCP0/edit)
>This is the online poll given out to RIT students to gauge need and interest in a new application to help navigation across the large campus. We planned to use this feedback from students to create a solution for students.

###[Features and content of new Mapping Application](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VMCpfnPU6qYgQ9UKkd7CwLgsGoDgL1YuATH8bjPY3tQ/edit)
>Once we had fully committed to addressing the mapping issue, we discussed further features that could be added to the application. Feature creep was becoming a major concern, but much of this document is a direct result of my one-on-one discussion with our very excited professor that had all sorts of new technology he thought would fit perfectly in our project. As a result, our simple mapping application now has VR and social features, as well as customized suggestions based on their class schedule and lots of GPS features similar to Waze.

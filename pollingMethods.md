## Online Survey Polling Notes

The importance of using the internet to distribute our questionnaire.

- Visibility - Many people will see the survey
- Audience - The people that will see the survey are also the ones most likely to actually do it.

Issues that can come from this type of data collection:

- Volunteer Bias - To minimize the potential volunteer bias, very little information is given upfront about - The conclusion we are expecting from the survey. All we tell them is it is a quick survey about how they navigate campus.

Channels we distribute through:

- Facebook/Email - Facebook and email are great for sending the survey to people we already know.
- Reddit - Reddit has a more people, and they cover a much more broad spectrum.

Actual formation of the questions:

- Brief Questions - It is important that the survey to be both brief and simple to answer. Ours is very short and multiple choice. It doesn't demand too much effort on the part of the interviewee.
- Optional Comment Area: Above and beyond the scope of the specific questions we wanted answered, there is also room for thoughts that the interviewee thinks deserve attention.
 
### In-person Interviews
In order to get a good sample of users, we do our interviews at different times of day and on different days of the week. This that our information doesn't skew towards any one type of student.
 
Our interview questions are framed in a different way than our online surveys. The interviews we do on campus are geared more towards getting a longer response. We ask questions that aren't easily answered by a yes or no, and we hope this provides us with more detailed information that can help us move in the right direction.
 
### Tour-guide Questionnaire
We believe the tour-guides have a unique and important viewpoint on the subject because of the experience the tour-guides have with navigating the campus and helping others navigate. The types of questions they get that may help us understand where the current system is lacking and where it is succeeding.
 
Similarly to the other "In-person" interview, these questions are focused more on getting the interviewee to speak, and not as much on a discrete set of answers. If we are able to get the tour-guides to speak their mind, we believe it will be some of the most important guidance we can get in our overall project.
 
### On-campus Observation
Our on-campus observation is as valuable to us as the actual interview.
By the observations we make while scouting around for interviews, we can determine:
How much foot-traffic an area usually gets
If the people here are generally confident about where they are going, or if they need help.
This information alone will give us what we need to find areas where people are having no issues and areas where people tend to get lost. For example, many people can be found on the quarter mile auto-piloting their way to class, but the tunnels might have more students looking like they need to find a map.
 
This kind of profiling will be important in finding where the weaknesses of the current system are, and who might have the most insight into the subject, greatly increasing the usefulness of our interviews.

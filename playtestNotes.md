## Playtest Notes
### 9/21/14
- 2 Players
- Me and Steve
- Game Unfinished (~60% by feel ~40% by VP cards remaining)
- Did not time

So, in a two-player game I knew there would be issues. Balance of character cards and luck in auction draws being the major issues, as in a two player version, these can spiral out of control and lead to a snowballing situation one player cannot recover from. This was sort of the case. I had a major advantage almost the whole time.

Steve felt that he was unable to get a team together with even a strength of 2, as I lucked into a player with +1 power and one with +2 power. Even when my power was only two, it was functionally 4, which is a MASSIVE advantage 1v1 versus a 2. Potentially a card advantage of around 4x. Another note about those cards is that they essentially bring any team into the stratosphere immediately, and there's no reason not to use them. a 1010 with +2 power is functionally a 3232 and that is pretty insanely overpowered.

**I will probably completely phase out the power bonus**, if the characters need that bonus, we can bake it into their stats.

**For the next test, I will tell players power bonus is simply a defense bonus.** Defense bonus is on the other end of the spectrum, and seems to not get any love. Basing this on a half of a 1v1 is a little premature though.

>Edit: on 9/22/14 Sean recommended I try using the power bonus as a single bonus applied to the team's lowest value. This will significantly effect the strength of that bonus, but the trade-off is that it might be a little confusing for new players. On 9/24/14 I will hopefully get a chance to test with 4 players, and I can try out his suggestion.

The aspect of lucky draws on auctions is major in one on one. Once a player gets an advantage like I had, I can essentially buy everything that comes up on either of our turns.

The cost of victory cards is not great. **I'm thinking I should reduce them all by one for the next test (hopefully 4 players) and allow anyone to get in on any VP auction for ony one ammo instead of the full amount.** This hopefully will encourage people to get ammo, and make a run on the ammo more of a possibility and a real impact on your game and strategy/vulnerability.

## Playtest Notes
### 9/22/14
- 4 Players
- S, Warlock, Flyer, X
- ~90 before I pulled the plug

This playtest was pretty bad. X's constant attitude issues and neediness to hold up the game was just a bummer. He had a bunch of really bad suggestions that I didn't even think where worth noting. Claimed to be an expert on deck builders, but judging by his examples, he doesn't know what he's talking about at all.

I don't think anyone had fun, it was the X Show, and we were all just sort of awkwardly stuck there until I just said "enough".

Here are the three thoughts that were worth noting:

- minimum power two-player, should change to some sort of base power 1 or 2
- instead of draws as ammo, ammo is base 1 per turn, and you can use modifiers for the rest
- reference cards


## Playtest Notes
### 9/29/14
- 4 Players
- J, K, P, and Bobby Zilch
- ~90

### Thoughts
- Is it always optimal to start your turn with an auction? Should it just be set as your first action?
- Isn't it always good to use your tactics at the beginning too? Anything that can get you draws?
- The game might play easier with a more structured turn order, like that.
- People aren't attacking, people aren't buying VPs. The way the tokens are scarce just adds to it. The winning player can generally refresh the market, then start a sale nobody can get in on.
- Reduce the actual point values on the VP cards. it's ridiculous.
- Players seem to like the idea of making each stat relevant to strategy in the game. (Ex. one stat is draw power, one is how many tactics you can play, etc..)

### Changes Implemented
- Instead of two "bench" stacks, there's now just the one. If a victory card is showing, you get that bonus.
- We treated all power bonuses as +1 power, even if they said +2 power. And even then, they were OP. If you can get a few of those, you essentially win.
- *At about 60% through the game* I removed the element of defending against attacks, because the only thing that could stop the landslide victory of a player was having him get attacked. But since he was so far ahead, he'd be able to defend all day, leaving the attacker without cards.

### Changes to Implement
- The bar chart is off on the 0421 card and on Mervin
- Clean up the mess from the VP cards. They cost a lot, rely on limited tokens, which allow gaming, and are worth a TON of points.
	- Nobody cares about the point value on the character and tactic chards if they are seeing people scoop up 8 point cards easily.

## New Ideas

The current mechanic that is giving me trouble is the core mechanic, balancing four stats efficiently for a successful team. This mechanic has been the core of the game for as long as it has existed. Since the game has undergone so many changes, some versions of the game actual synergize better with this mechanic than others. The simpler version of the game worked well because it was just how you score points. Now that the game is essentially more complicated than dominion, having EVERYTHING depend on that one thing massively unbalances everything.

### Mission-critical Changes
- Must shorten length of game significantly
- Reduce overlap with dominion
- Enhance control over what you can buy
- Make combat more central

My first idea was to do parallel iterations, one with a barebones game more similar to earlier versions, and one where I try to balance out the deckbuilder version. Now I'm deciding I need to concentrate on simplifying, enhancing player control and interaction, and reducing the aspects of a deckbuilder that make it less fun. Dominion works because everyone has the ability to buy whatever anyone else has. Nobody gets a lucky draw that gives them *exactly* what they need, and creates a feedback loop of success. The original version of this game worked better because it had a market system very closely related to Power Grid. This allowed everyone a good amount of options, and they knew what they were getting. It also gave the game a natural progression from good cards to much gooderer cards. Keeping certain elements from that game that worked *because of* that system, and trying to shoe-horn it into Dominion was very rough. Especially since the market was *very* random, to the degree that the market in Bohnanza is random.

I want to meet halfway, so I'm thinking of really coming up with a market system more related to where it started, Power Grid and Copy Cat. This lets me get back to the roots of the game, and potentially solve some thematic issues that I haven't thought about in a while. One of which is that originally this was supposed to be sort of a faux-cooperative game (at least thematically). The players where all fighting against a lineup of enemy players. This would make more sense to me, scoring points for knocking out players on the line-up, and allow a more Copy Cat-ish conveyor-belt market. Thematically it could be the players opposing your team, and you are recruiting them to your side.

One of the earliest concepts for this game also included abilities that where specific to certain things like having team speed at at certain level, or whatever. This would allow things like building a team that seemed to have it's own personality. Intelligence was one of the stats at that point, so you could possibly have a team full of nerds, and have them do things like cobble together a dodgeball cannon out of gym equipment. I can actually imagine having things sort of like this in the form of event or action cards.

Maybe event cards can be struggles that have to be overcome when you buy past them in the market like the bad cards in Copy Cat. This could actually involve cooperation/aggression with other players to manage who has to deal with the issues when.

I'm going to hold off on testing the existing game for now, and work on restructuring it around a more workable market system, and a shorter game. After initial frustration with how convoluted this project is getting after all these changes, I'm now seeing what works about it and what doesn't which is allowing me to revisit what initially was exciting, and getting back to that zone with more skill/knowledge/information than I had the first time around.

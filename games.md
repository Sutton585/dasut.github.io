After winning Exhibitor Magazine’s 2017 Sizzle Award for our interactive booth at the annual ExhibitorLive, the premier Conference for Trade Show and Corporate Event Marketing, my group (Mirror Show Management) wanted to up the ante in 2018 with a fully interactive multiplayer game-show-in-a-booth. My experience in Game Design, UX  and Product Design helped us great a truly unique gaming experience.

### Card Game Design

This is a card game I made a few years ago. It started out very simple, but I ended up using it for a study I wrote as a user testing to guide iterative game design. The idea was to start with a simple game, user-test, iterate, and end up with something amazing.

Right now, the images [in this link](](http://www.davidsutton.net/portfolio/dodgeball-title/)) are roughs of the cards from the latest iteration that went to print. As a result, I left in the cut and bleed lines so that you can see more than what made it onto the card. I might clean the images up a bit as I revise this portfolio section. Leaving bleed lines in gives a good impression of how they're printed, but I think it might look sloppy for an online portfolio.

### Horror Western RPG Game Design

This is another game design project. I worked on the setting for a tabletop RPG that mashes up the “wild west” feel with a supernatural horror. This was a lot of fun for me.

The most natural setting for the game was Deadwood, South Dakota. So many legendary figures of the old west came through that town, and I have the benefit of a great HBO show to guide some of the art. The style I was going for is a mash-up of the Deadwood TV show and the art style from the video game Borderlands. What I wanted to end up with is sort of a grungy but high contrast comic feel.

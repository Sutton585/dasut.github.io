## Game-Related Design

### Card Game Design

This is a card game I made a few years ago. It started out very simple, but I ended up using it for a study I wrote as a user testing to guide iterative game design. The idea was to start with a simple game, user-test, iterate, and end up with something amazing.

Right now, the images [in this link](](http://www.davidsutton.net/portfolio/dodgeball-title/)) are roughs of the cards from the latest iteration that went to print. As a result, I left in the cut and bleed lines so that you can see more than what made it onto the card. I might clean the images up a bit as I revise this portfolio section. Leaving bleed lines in gives a good impression of how they're printed, but I think it might look sloppy for an online portfolio.

This is another game design project. I worked on the setting for a tabletop RPG that mashes up the “wild west” feel with a supernatural horror. This was a lot of fun for me.

The most natural setting for the game was Deadwood, South Dakota. So many legendary figures of the old west came through that town, and I have the benefit of a great HBO show to guide some of the art. The style I was going for is a mash-up of the Deadwood TV show and the art style from the video game Borderlands. What I wanted to end up with is sort of a grungy but high contrast comic feel.
